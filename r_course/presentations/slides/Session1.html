## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 

One of the most noticeable differences comes from the emphasis on code readability:
it uses significant indentation 

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported some tools require it. 

---
## What is Python to you?

Python has a huge user base across many disciplines. These users have developed a wide range of libraries which you can use.  

As python is used by many fields, it is a useful language for adapting novel approaches for bioinformatics:
such as deep learning methods for scRNAseq or Image Analysis


![TIOBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index#/media/File:Tiobeindex.png)

---
## Pyhton vs R

Though R has long been the key coding language in bioinformatics, python is growing in use. 

Though there are core utility packages that have been around a long time such as Biopython. It is the new technique-specific packages that are driving the surging popularity of python i.e Scanpy.

## Setting Up Conda and Python

Many laptops will come with python installed so getting started is easy. 

We will run a custom install of python using conda. Conda manages software and packages. Using Conda should make installations much easier and allow us to keep track of software versions. 

We can install Conda from here. We will specifically want to use Miniconda:

https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

If you have instaled this correctly, running this on terminal/command prompt should give you a list of conda commands


``` sh
conda
```


---
## Setting Up Conda and Python

Conda is built on the idea of environments. An environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of Conda packages that you have installed. For today we will make sure we have python and the python packages we need for the training.

The first step is we create a new environment. We will then activate it to expose the environment. 

Lastly we can install python.


``` sh

 conda create -n intro_to_python
 conda activate intro_to_python
 conda install python

```

---
## Setting Up Conda and Python

We also want some specific Python packages. These mostly contain functions that are not present in the base Python distribution. 


``` sh
conda install 

```


---
## Interactive or scripts?

As with many languages you can work with python in two main ways:
interactive or scripts

When people think about coding they are often thinking about the interactive console. When you work in this way lines of code are submitted as you enter them. You often do this when you are developing an analysis and trying out parameters. This is mostly how we will work in the training. 

When you want to automate something, i.e. an analysis workflow, you will write a script. You can then run this script with python.

---
## Python and IDEs

You can run python from within your terminal/command prompt. This will give you access to the python console.

Many people prefer to sue an Integrated Development Environment to augment their experience while coding. They allow easy writing of scripts, visualization of plots, and access to many customizablefeature in additional panes. 

We will be using VS code from Windows. 


---
## Navigating VS Code


---
## Keeping Your Code Nice - Notebooks

There exists many ways in which to store your code. Most fo the time we are not writing scripts that are production level which we will reude. Instead you will be doing an analysis of a some data. 

Notebooks give you a means to tie the code and the result of the code together into a single file. 

There are several options for python. But Jupyter Notebook is best know. Quarto is growing in popularity as its universal and language agnostic.

# Data Types and Functions in Python

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

## Simple Calculation

At its simplest you can just use python as a fancy calculator:


``` python
1+1
```

```
## 2
```

``` python
2*5
```

```
## 10
```

---
## Functions

To take things further there are many functions built-in to python. These are saved chun ks of code that will do a task based on the arguments you provide. You can tell there is a function when there is a string immediately followed by a set of parenthesis:

*myfunction()*

Here we use the round function:


``` python
round(3.14159)
```

```
## 3
```

---
## Help with functions

To get help with a function you can use the *help()* function. This will open up the help page for this function. Hopefully this will contain information about what arguments it are accepted and what is returned by the function. In this case we can see there is an additonal optional argument *ndigits*. This has a default value of **None**.


``` python
help(round)
```

```
## Help on built-in function round in module builtins:
## 
## round(number, ndigits=None)
##     Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.
##     
##     The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.  Otherwise
##     the return value has the same type as the number.  ndigits may be negative.
```

---
## Function and arguments

If we want to update our rounding result to allow for more decimal places we can add the second argument. For simple function like this, s long as the order is correct we do not to specify the argument. 


``` python
round(3.14159, 3)
```

```
## 3.142
```

We can still run a function with disordered arguments by naming them. 


``` python
round(ndigits=3, number=3.14159)
```

```
## 3.142
```

 
---
## Variables

Often you will want to save something in your environment for use later on. We do this by creating a variable by assignment with the **=** sign.


``` python
greeting = 'Hello!'
greeting
```

```
## 'Hello!'
```


``` python
number = 3.14159
number
```

```
## 3.14159
```

---
## Variables

When assigning a variable there are certain things you can and cannot do.

Good:

* Only letters, numbers, and the underscore

Bad:

* Don't use non-alphanumerics. This includes: . % + - * #  
* You can't start with a number

The best thing to do is name it something short and simple, that makes sense.

---
## Variables and functions

Once we have a variable we can then use it inside functions. The vector name is acting as an alias for what it contains.


``` python
number
```

```
## 3.14159
```


``` python
round(number)
```

```
## 3
```


---
## Variables

There are many kinds of variables. The most basic types are: *str*,*float* and *int*. You can always check what kind you have with the *type()* function.


``` python
greeting = 'Hello!'
type(greeting )
```

```
## &lt;class 'str'&gt;
```


``` python
number = 3.14159
type(number )
```

```
## &lt;class 'float'&gt;
```


``` python
newnumber = round(number)
newnumber
```

```
## 3
```

``` python
type(newnumber)
```

```
## &lt;class 'int'&gt;
```

---
## Variables Coercion

We can manually set the type using: *str()*, *float()* and *int()*. 


``` python
string_number = str(number)
string_number
```

```
## '3.14159'
```


``` python
float_string_number = float(string_number)
float_string_number 
```

```
## 3.14159
```


``` python
int_float_string_number = int(float_string_number)
int_float_string_number 
```

```
## 3
```

---
## Variables Coercion

These functions do not always work, if there is not a clear rationale for how to resolve the function.


``` python
greeting = 'Hello!'
int(greeting)
```


```
## could not convert string to float: 'Hello!'
```

---
## Concatenation

Strings can be concatenated easily.


``` python
newgreeting = 'Hi' ' there'
newgreeting
```

```
## 'Hi there'
```

``` python
newgreeting2 = 'Hi' + ' there'
newgreeting2
```

```
## 'Hi there'
```

``` python
newgreeting3 = 'Hi'
newgreeting3 += ' there'
newgreeting3 
```

```
## 'Hi there'
```


``` python
newgreeting4 = 'Hi' * 5
newgreeting4
```

```
## 'HiHiHiHiHi'
```

---
## Lists

Python has many options for storing data. The simplest is a list. Lists are denoted with square brackets. 


``` python
my_strs = ['a','b','c','d','e']
my_strs
```

```
## ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```


``` python
my_ints= [1,2,3,4,5]
my_ints
```

```
## [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```


``` python
my_floats = [1.1,2.2,3.3,4.4,5.5]
my_floats
```

```
## [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]
```

---
## Indexing Lists

We can also use the square brackets to extract specific values from our list. 


``` python
my_strs[2]
```

```
## 'c'
```

Here we get the third value from our list using the number 2. That is because python uses zero indexing; counting in python starts at 0, not 1. 


``` python
my_strs[0]
```

```
## 'a'
```

---
## Indexing Lists

Sometimes we have a long list, but we know we want the final value. We can use a *-* to indicate how far from the end we want to index.


``` python
my_strs[-1]
```

```
## 'e'
```

We can also create a sublist by slicing our list with the *:*.


``` python
my_strs[2:4]
```

```
## ['c', 'd']
```


``` python
my_strs[2:-1]
```

```
## ['c', 'd']
```


``` python
my_strs[2:]
```

```
## ['c', 'd', 'e']
```



``` python
my_strs[0] = 'z'
```


make an error on purpose


---
## Complex Lists

List are general containers for a variety of data types. This means you can make a list of lists!


``` python
my_lists = ["a",['b1','b2'], ['c1',['c2']]]
my_lists
```

```
## ['a', ['b1', 'b2'], ['c1', ['c2']]]
```

We can still use indexing to deal with this mess of lists


``` python
my_lists[2][1][0]
```

```
## 'c2'
```

---
## Indexing Lists



``` python
my_lists
```

```
## ['a', ['b1', 'b2'], ['c1', ['c2']]]
```

``` python
list1, list2, list3 = my_lists
list1
```

```
## 'a'
```

``` python
list2
```

```
## ['b1', 'b2']
```

``` python
list3
```

```
## ['c1', ['c2']]
```

---
## Concatenation

We can concatenate lists, just as we did with strings.


``` python
biglist = my_strs + my_ints
biglist
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```


``` python
biglist = my_strs 
biglist += my_ints
biglist
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```


``` python
biglist = my_strs * 5
biglist
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

---
## Functions and lists

There are many useful functions for working with lists. Many of these functions work directly on the list. This means you don't need to assign the result back to the object. The structure is VARIABLE.function(). Here we use the append function to extend our list.


``` python
my_strs.append('f')
my_strs
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'f']
```


``` python
my_strs.append(1)
my_strs
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'f', 1]
```

---
## Functions and lists

There are many useful functions built into the base version of python. 

* .insert() inserts an argument into a specfic postion in the list


``` python
my_strs.insert(3,'c')
my_strs
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'f', 1]
```

* remove() inserts an argument into a specfic postion in the list


``` python
my_strs.remove('c')
my_strs
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'f', 1]
```

* del() inserts an argument into a specfic postion in the list


``` python
del(my_strs[3])
my_strs
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'e', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'f', 1]
```


* .index() reveals which position in the list is the supplied argument


``` python
my_strs.index('c')
```

```
## 2
```

* .sort() will sort your list


``` python
my_list = [1,4,9,4,11,12,6]
my_list.sort()
my_list
```

```
## [1, 4, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12]
```

``` python
my_list.sort(reverse=True)
my_list
```

```
## [12, 11, 9, 6, 4, 4, 1]
```

``` python
my_list = ["b","c","a"]
my_list.sort()
my_list
```

```
## ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

---
## Tuples

Tuples are another type of object in python. They look and behave a lot like lists. But where lists are dynamic and mutable, tuples cannot be changed. As a result tuples are more memory efficient than lists.

When making a tuple you use parentheses instead of square brackets. 


``` python
my_tuple = ('a','b','c','d','e')
my_tuple[0] = 'z'
```


```
## 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```


``` python
my_list = ['a','b','c','d','e']
my_list[0] = 'z'
my_list
```

```
## ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

---
## A quick aside

You will run into errors coding. 

DON'T PANIC. 

Most of the time the error messages are very clear. And if they are not a quick google will often clear it up. 

---
## Tuple/List coercion

As with str/int/float you can easily convert a list to a tuple and vice versa. Simply use the *list()* and *tuple()* functions. 


``` python
my_list = ['a','b','c','d','e']
my_tuple_list = tuple(my_list)
my_tuple_list
```

```
## ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
```

``` python
type(my_tuple_list)
```

```
## &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
```


``` python
my_list_tuple_list = list(my_tuple_list)
my_list_tuple_list
```

```
## ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

``` python
type(my_list_tuple_list)
```

```
## &lt;class 'list'&gt;
```

---
## Functions, tuples and lists

**Remember!**

* Square brackets [] for indexing and lists.


* Parentheses () for functions and tuples.

---
## Dictionaries

Another data type are dictionaries. Dcionaries are made of key:value pairs. 

A key is some kind of identifier, typically a short string. The value is a corresponding piece of data that is often more complex. 

This structure allows the organiztion of your data, and you can gives you the ability to grab out values using the key.
  
---
## Dictionaries


``` python
my_dict = {
    'my_list': [1,2,3],
    'my_tuple': (4,5,6),
    'language': 'python',
    'technique': 'scRNAseq'
}
my_dict
```

```
## {'my_list': [1, 2, 3], 'my_tuple': (4, 5, 6), 'language': 'python', 'technique': 'scRNAseq'}
```

---
## Dictionaries


``` python
my_dict.keys()
```

```
## dict_keys(['my_list', 'my_tuple', 'language', 'technique'])
```



``` python
my_dict.values()
```

```
## dict_values([[1, 2, 3], (4, 5, 6), 'python', 'scRNAseq'])
```


``` python
my_dict.items()
```

```
## dict_items([('my_list', [1, 2, 3]), ('my_tuple', (4, 5, 6)), ('language', 'python'), ('technique', 'scRNAseq')])
```

---
## Dictionaries


``` python
my_dict['my_list']
```

```
## [1, 2, 3]
```


``` python
my_dict['language']
```

```
## 'python'
```

``` python
my_dict.get('language')
```

```
## 'python'
```



``` python
my_dict.setdefault('metadata', True)
```

```
## True
```

``` python
my_dict
```

```
## {'my_list': [1, 2, 3], 'my_tuple': (4, 5, 6), 'language': 'python', 'technique': 'scRNAseq', 'metadata': True}
```


``` python
'metadata' in my_dict.keys()
```

```
## True
```

``` python
'metadata' in my_dict
```

```
## True
```



``` python
'scRNAseq' in my_dict.values()
```

```
## True
```


---
## Concatenating Dictionaries



``` python
dict_1 = {'my_list': [1,2,3],
  'my_tuple': (4,5,6),}
  
dict_2 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

Unpacking operator


``` python
dict_3 = {**dict_1, **dict_2}
dict_3
```

```
## {'my_list': [1, 2, 3], 'my_tuple': (4, 5, 6), 'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

Merge with pipe


``` python
dict_3 = dict_1 | dict_2
dict_3
```

```
## {'my_list': [1, 2, 3], 'my_tuple': (4, 5, 6), 'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

Update function


``` python
dict_1.update(dict_2)

dict_1
```

```
## {'my_list': [1, 2, 3], 'my_tuple': (4, 5, 6), 'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```


---
## Sets


``` python
myset = {"a", "b", "c"}
myset
```

```
## {'b', 'a', 'c'}
```

``` python
myset = set(["a", "b", "c"])
myset
```

```
## {'b', 'a', 'c'}
```

---
## Sets can be modified


``` python
myset.add("d")
myset
```

```
## {'b', 'a', 'd', 'c'}
```


``` python
myset.remove("d")
myset
```

```
## {'b', 'a', 'c'}
```

---
## Sets have no order

As sets have no order they can't be subset in the same way that other objects can be. 


``` python
myset[0]
```


```
## 'set' object is not subscriptable
```

---
## Sets are unique


``` python
myset = set(["a", "b", "c","c","c"])
myset
```

```
## {'b', 'a', 'c'}
```

---
## Sets have specific functions


``` python
myset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
myset2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
myset1.union(myset2)
```

```
## {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```
 
 

``` python
myset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
myset2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
myset1.difference(myset2)
```

```
## {1, 2}
```
 
---
## Set vs List
 
* A list allows duplicate elements and maintains their order
* A set ensures element uniqueness without any guaranteed order



---
## Making functions

Key parts:
* function name
* arguments
* code
* return values (sometimes)

---
## Making functions

Function structure:

def - indicates you will define a function
function name - in this case *myFirstFunction*
arguments - any arguments that the function expects in parentheses
code - the start of the code is indicated by a colon, new line and indentation
return - this is the result that you wish to be delivered from the function


``` python
def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  return sumNum

myResult = myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)
myResult
```

```
## 5
```



---
## Returning multiple values

We can only return 1 object at a time from function. Here we create the multiple of our numbers and try and return alongside our sum. It wont even let us define the function. 


``` python
def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  return sumNum multipleNum
```


```
## File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1
##     return sumNum multipleNum
## IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

---
## Returning multiple values

A simple solution is to pass back an object that contains both results. Here we create a quick list.



``` python
def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  return [sumNum, multipleNum]

myResult = myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)
myResult
```

```
## [5, 6]
```

---
## Evaluate until return

In a function containing a return statement, the code up until the return statement is evaluated and anything after the return statement is not evaluated.


``` python
def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  print("Before return")
  return [sumNum, multipleNum]
  print("After return")

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)
```

```
## Before return
## [5, 6]
```

---
## No return statement

If a function does not contain a return statement nothing will come back. In other languages this is not the case. 


``` python

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)
```

## Variable scope in functions

Variables defined in the arguments or within the function exist only within the environment of the function.


``` python
def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  return [sumNum, multipleNum]

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)

sumNum
```


```
## [5, 6]
```

```
## name 'sumNum' is not defined
```

## Variable scope in functions

If a function makes changes to variables defined in the global environment they will not be updated in the global environment.


``` python
num3 = 4

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2, num3):
  num3 = num1+num2+num3
  return num3

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3, num3=num3)

num3
```


## Local vs Global scope

* Functions have local scope. This means they have access to global variables can be used anywhere and local variables which were made within the function. 

* Once you exit the function you are in the console you are back to a global scope. Local variables can not be accessed at this point. 

* Code in a function’s local scope cannot use variables in any other local scope i.e. between functions.

* Though it is possible to have local and global variables with the same name, try and give everything unique names so you can keep track of everything. 


---
## Argument defaults

Functions can have defaults for their arguments which will be used when arguments are not specified.


``` python
def myFirstFunction(num1=1,num2=3):
  sumNum = num1+num2
  return sumNum

myFirstFunction()
```

```
## 4
```


``` python
myFirstFunction(5,10)
```

```
## 15
```


---
## Control Statements

There are several ways to control how your code is evaluated. There are two main classes:

Conditional branching (if,else)
Loops (for, while)


&lt;span style="color:green"&gt;While&lt;/span&gt; I'm analysing data, &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; I need to execute complex statistical procedures on the data I will use Python &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; I will use a calculator.

---
## Conditional Branching

Conditional branching is the evaluation of a logical to determine whether a chunk of code is executed.

In Python, we use the if statement with the logical to be evaluated immediately after. The  dependent code is indicated by a colon, new line and indentation.


``` python
x = True
if x:
  print("x is true")
```

```
## x is true
```


``` python

x = False
if x:
  print("x is true")
```

---
## Conditional Branching

More often, we construct the logical value within the if statement itself. This can be termed the condition.


``` python
x = 10
y = 4
if x &gt; y:
  print("The value of x is",x,"which is greater than", y)
```

```
## The value of x is 10 which is greater than 4
```
The message is printed above because x is greater than y.



``` python
y = 20
if x &gt; y:
  print("The value of x is",x,"which is greater than", y)
```

x is now no longer greater than y, so no message is printed.

We really still want a message telling us what was the result of the condition.

---
## else following an if

If we want to perform an operation when the condition is false we can follow the *if* statement with an *else* statement.



``` python
x = 3
if x &lt; 5:
  print(x, "is less than to 5")
else:
  print(x, "is greater than or equal to 5")
```

```
## 3 is less than to 5
```


``` python
x = 10
if x &lt; 5:
  print(x, "is less than to 5")
else:
  print(x, "is greater than or equal to 5")
```

```
## 10 is greater than or equal to 5
```

---
## else if = elif

We may wish to execute different procedures under multiple conditions. This can be controlled using the *elif* following an initial *if* statement.


``` python
x = 5
if x &lt; 5:
  print(x, "is less than to 5")
elif x &gt; 5:
  print(x, "is greater than 5")
else:
  print(x, "is 5")
```

```
## 5 is 5
```

---
## Loops

While and for loops iterate over a block of code, and keep rerunning it. 

*While* loops do this while a specific condition is met (or until that condition is not met).

*For* loops will do this for a given number of iterations.

---
## While Loop

While loops have a similar structure to if statements. We start by designating the while loop, ten follow with the logical to be evaluated immediately after. The  dependent code is indicated by a colon, new line and indentation.


``` python
x = 1
while x &lt; 3:
  print("x is",x)
  x = x+1
```

```
## x is 1
## x is 2
```

---
## For Loop

For loops do not have a condtional. Instead you supply an object that you want to be iterate over. This can be a list, tuple, dictionary, set or string. Here we use a list. 


``` python
x = ['Alpha','Bravo','Charlie']
for i in x:
  print(i)
```

```
## Alpha
## Bravo
## Charlie
```


---
## for and range()

The range() function provides us with a nice input for our for loops. It returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 and stops before the specified number.


``` python
for i in range(3):
  print("i is", i)
```

```
## i is 0
## i is 1
## i is 2
```

---
## Looping through indices

When we have a numeric range, we can use it to index out from existing objects. This often allows for more complex code evaluation. 


``` python
geneName = ["Ikzf1","Myc","Igll1"]
expression = [10.4, 4.3, 6.5]
iterations = len(geneName)

for i in range(iterations):
  print(geneName[i]," has an TPM of ",expression[i])
```

```
## Ikzf1  has an TPM of  10.4
## Myc  has an TPM of  4.3
## Igll1  has an TPM of  6.5
```


---
## Loops and conditionals

Loops can be combined with conditional statements to allow for complex control of their execution over Python objects. Though these can be tough to read and create, by keeping an eye of the hierarchy of identation we can follow the logic. 


``` python
x = range(8)

for i in range(8):
  if i &gt; 5:
    print("Number",i,"is greater than 5")
  elif i == 5:
    print("Number",i,"is  5") 
  else:
    print("Number",i,"is less than 5") 
```

```
## Number 0 is less than 5
## Number 1 is less than 5
## Number 2 is less than 5
## Number 3 is less than 5
## Number 4 is less than 5
## Number 5 is  5
## Number 6 is greater than 5
## Number 7 is greater than 5
```

---
## Breaking loops

We can use conditionals to exit a loop if a condition is satisfied, just like a while loop.


``` python
x = range(8)

for i in range(8):
  if i &gt; 5:
    print("Number",i,"is greater than 5")
  elif i == 5:
    print("Number",i,"is  5")
    break
  else:
    print("Number",i,"is less than 5") 
```

```
## Number 0 is less than 5
## Number 1 is less than 5
## Number 2 is less than 5
## Number 3 is less than 5
## Number 4 is less than 5
## Number 5 is  5
```








Day 1:
- Set up - install, conda, vs etc
- Basic interaction - interactive vs scripts, .py files vs Jupyter notebooks (vs Quarto?)
- Data types:
  * str, int, float
  * List
  * Tuple
  * Library
  * Include indexing, modification and concatenation for each
  * arrays and numpy?
  * sets, comparison to lists (ordered vs unordered)
-Variables (defining, changing values)
-Using existing functions (ex: print)
-Defining your own functions and calling them (with example using variables)
-Interpreting error messages
-Finding and understanding python documentation online  

Day 2: 
- Reading/Writing (and working directory)
- Control Statements
  * if
  * for
  * while
- List comprehension This I could take or leave, I would rather use the time to teach them new functionalities rather than shorten ones they already know
-Example of making a more complex function that uses:
Data read/writing
Control statements
Ex: read in data, do some conditional mathematical manipulation/data cleaning, write to a file
 
- Regex Do you mean the re package? If so I am not sure this is useful to the beginner Python user - maybe something to mention when talking about string operations but I don't know that I would go deeply into this. If you think it's useful though I am open to it.
- Plotting
-Showcase/discussion of other useful packages and what they can be used for (no need to use them, but just discuss) (pandas, scipy, scikit learn, biopython, etc.)






## Slide Structure

We use the a double has/pound for slides. This is important for hierarchy. If you use 1 it will work for the slides, but will mess up the single page version.


## Left/Right alignment

To show things side by side on a slide you can use pull left/right. t is important to keep the tab on the second square bracket. On single page it will just be one after the other:

.pull-left[
This will be on left of slide
  ] 
  
.pull-right[
This will be on right

 ]


## Data from external sources

everything in the rmd is relative to the inst/extdata directory so you have some data to load in, just put it in the data directory, read it in along the path. 
The structure is maintained for those attending the course and download the package using the instructions. The same rules are followed for imgs and scripts that you may call.
