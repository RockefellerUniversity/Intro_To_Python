## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 

One of the most noticeable differences comes from the emphasis on code readability:
it uses significant indentation 

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported some tools require it. 

---
## What is Python to you?

Python has a huge user base across many disciplines. These users have developed a wide range of libraries which you can use.  

As python is used by many fields, it is a useful language for adapting novel approaches for bioinformatics:
such as deep learning methods for scRNAseq or Image Analysis


![TIOBE](imgs/Tiobeindex.png)

---
## Pyhton vs R

Though R has long been the cornerstone of bioinformatics, python is growing in use. 

Though there are core utility packages that have been around a long time such as Biopython. It is the new technique-specific packages that are driving the surging popularity of python i.e Scanpy.

## Setting Up Conda and Python

Many laptops will come with python installed so getting started is easy. 

We will run a custom install of python using conda. Conda manages software and packages. Using Conda should make installations much easier and allow us to keep track of software versions. 

We can install Conda from here. We will specifically want to use Miniconda:

https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

If you have instaled this correctly, running this on terminal/command prompt should give you a list of conda commands

```{sh, eval=F}
conda
```


---
## Setting Up Conda and Python

Conda is built on the idea of environments. An environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of Conda packages that you have installed. For today we will make sure we have python and the python packages we need for the training.

The first step is we create a new environment. We will then activate it to expose the environment. 

Lastly we can install python.

```{sh, eval=F}

 conda create -n intro_to_python
 conda activate intro_to_python
 conda install python


```

---
## Setting Up Conda and Python

We also want some specific Python packages. These mostly contain functions that are not present in the base Python distribution. 

```{sh, eval=F}
conda install numpy
conda install scipy
conda install matplotlib
conda install seaborn

```


---
## Interactive or scripts?

As with many languages you can work with python in two main ways:
interactive or scripts

When people think about coding they are often thinking about the interactive console. When you work in this way lines of code are submitted as you enter them. You often do this when you are developing an analysis and trying out parameters. This is mostly how we will work in the training. 

When you want to automate something, i.e. an analysis workflow, you will write a script. You can then run this script with python.

---
## Python and IDEs

You can run python from within your terminal/command prompt. This will give you access to the python console.

Many people prefer to sue an Integrated Development Environment to augment their experience while coding. They allow easy writing of scripts, visualization of plots, and access to many customizablefeature in additional panes. 

We will be using VS code from Windows. 


---
## Navigating VS Code


---
## Keeping Your Code Nice - Notebooks

There exists many ways in which to store your code. Most fo the time we are not writing scripts that are production level which we will reude. Instead you will be doing an analysis of a some data. 

Notebooks give you a means to tie the code and the result of the code together into a single file. 

There are several options for python. But Jupyter Notebook is best know. Quarto is growing in popularity as its universal and language agnostic.

  )
}else{
  cat("# Varaibles and Functions in Python

"    
  )
  
}

```



## Simple Calculation

At its simplest you can just use python as a fancy calculator:

```{python}
1+1
```
```{python}
2*5
```

---
## Functions

To take things further there are many functions built-in to python. These are saved chun ks of code that will do a task based on the arguments you provide. You can tell there is a function when there is a string immediately followed by a set of parenthesis:

*myfunction()*

Here we use the round function:

```{python}
round(3.14159)
```

---
## Help with functions

To get help with a function you can use the *help()* function. This will open up the help page for this function. Hopefully this will contain information about what arguments it are accepted and what is returned by the function. In this case we can see there is an additonal optional argument *ndigits*. This has a default value of **None**.

```{python}
help(round)
```

---
## Function and arguments

If we want to update our rounding result to allow for more decimal places we can add the second argument. For simple function like this, s long as the order is correct we do not to specify the argument. 

```{python}
round(3.14159, 3)
```

We can still run a function with disordered arguments by naming them. 

```{python}
round(ndigits=3, number=3.14159)
```

 
---
## Variables

Often you will want to save something in your environment for use later on. We do this by creating a variable by assignment with the **=** sign.

```{python}
greeting = 'Hello!'
greeting
```

```{python}
number = 3.14159
number
```

---
## Variables

When assigning a variable there are certain things you can and cannot do.

Good:

* Only letters, numbers, and the underscore

Bad:

* Don't use non-alphanumerics. This includes: . % + - * #  
* You can't start with a number

The best thing to do is name it something short and simple, that makes sense.

---
## Variables and functions

Once we have a variable we can then use it inside functions. The vector name is acting as an alias for what it contains.

```{python}
number
```

```{python}
round(number)

```


---
## Variables

There are many kinds of variables. The most basic types are: *str*,*float*, *int* and *boolean*. You can always check what kind you have with the *type()* function.

```{python}
greeting = 'Hello!'
type(greeting )
```

```{python}
number = 3.14159
type(number )
```

```{python}
newnumber = round(number)
newnumber
```

```{python}
type(newnumber)
```

```{python}
boolean = True
type(boolean)
```

---
## Variables Coercion

We can manually set the type using: *str()*, *float()*, *int()* and *bool()*. 

```{python}
string_number = str(number)
string_number
```

```{python}
float_string_number = float(string_number)
float_string_number 

```

```{python}
int_float_string_number = int(float_string_number)
int_float_string_number 

```

```{python}
int_float_string_number_boolean = bool(float_string_number)
int_float_string_number_boolean

```

---
## Variables Coercion

These functions do not always work, if there is not a clear rationale for how to resolve the function.

```{python, eval=F}
greeting = 'Hello!'
int(greeting)
```

```{python, eval=T, echo=F}

try:
  float(greeting)
except Exception as e:
  print(e)
  
```

---
## Concatenation

Strings can be concatenated easily.

```{python}
newgreeting = 'Hi' ' there'
newgreeting
```
```{python}
newgreeting2 = 'Hi' + ' there'
newgreeting2
```
```{python}
newgreeting3 = 'Hi'
newgreeting3 += ' there'
newgreeting3 
```

```{python}
newgreeting4 = 'Hi' * 5
newgreeting4
```

"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Data Objects

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

---
## Lists

Python has many options for storing data. The simplest is a list. Lists are denoted with square brackets. 

```{python}

my_strs = ['a','b','c','d','e']
my_strs

```

```{python}

my_ints= [1,2,3,4,5]
my_ints

```

```{python}

my_floats = [1.1,2.2,3.3,4.4,5.5]
my_floats

```

---
## Indexing Lists

We can also use the square brackets to extract specific values from our list. 

```{python}
my_strs[2]
```

Here we get the third value from our list using the number 2. That is because python uses zero indexing; counting in python starts at 0, not 1. 

```{python}
my_strs[0]
```

---
## Indexing Lists

Sometimes we have a long list, but we know we want the final value. We can use a *-* to indicate how far from the end we want to index.

```{python}
my_strs[-1]
```

We can also create a sublist by slicing our list with the *:*.

```{python}
my_strs[2:4]
```

```{python}
my_strs[2:-1]
```

```{python}
my_strs[2:]
```


---
## Complex Lists

List are general containers for a variety of data types. This means you can make a list of lists!

```{python}
my_lists = ["a",['b1','b2'], ['c1',['c2']]]
my_lists
```

We can still use indexing to deal with this mess of lists

```{python}
my_lists[2][1][0]
```

---
## Indexing Lists

We can use the assignment we have been using this whole time to break open this nested list structure. 


```{python}
my_lists
list1, list2, list3 = my_lists
list1
list2
list3
```

---
## Concatenation

We can concatenate lists, just as we did with strings.

```{python}
biglist = my_strs + my_ints
biglist
```

```{python}
biglist = my_strs 
biglist += my_ints
biglist
```

```{python}
biglist = my_strs * 5
biglist
```

---
## Functions and lists

There are many useful functions for working with lists. Many of these functions work directly on the list. This means you don't need to assign the result back to the object. The structure is VARIABLE.function(). These are called attributes. Here we use the append function to extend our list.

```{python}
my_strs.append('f')
my_strs
```

```{python}
my_strs.append(1)
my_strs
```

---
## Functions and lists

There are many useful functions built into the base version of python. 

* .insert() inserts an argument into a specfic postion in the list

```{python}
my_strs.insert(3,'c')
my_strs
```

* remove() inserts an argument into a specfic postion in the list

```{python}
my_strs.remove('c')
my_strs
```

* del() inserts an argument into a specfic postion in the list

```{python}
del(my_strs[3])
my_strs
```

---
## Functions and lists

There are many useful functions built into the base version of python. 


* .index() reveals which position in the list is the supplied argument

```{python}
my_strs.index('c')
```

* .sort() will sort your list

```{python}
my_list = [1,4,9,4,11,12,6]
my_list.sort()
my_list
my_list.sort(reverse=True)
my_list
my_list = ["b","c","a"]
my_list.sort()
my_list
```

---
## Tuples

Tuples are another type of object in python. They look and behave a lot like lists. But where lists are dynamic and mutable, tuples cannot be changed. As a result tuples are more memory efficient than lists.

When making a tuple you use parentheses instead of square brackets. 


```{python}
my_list = ['a','b','c','d','e']
my_list[0] = 'z'
my_list
```

```{python, eval=F}
my_tuple = ('a','b','c','d','e')
my_tuple[0] = 'z'
```

```{python, eval=T, echo=F}
my_tuple = ('a','b','c','d','e')
try:
  my_tuple[0] = 'z'
except Exception as e:
  print(e)
  
```

---
## A quick aside

You will run into errors coding. 

DON'T PANIC. 

Most of the time the error messages are very clear. And if they are not a quick google will often clear it up. 

---
## Tuple/List coercion

As with str/int/float/bool you can easily convert a list to a tuple and vice versa. Simply use the *list()* and *tuple()* functions. 

```{python}
my_list = ['a','b','c','d','e']
my_tuple_list = tuple(my_list)
my_tuple_list
type(my_tuple_list)
```

```{python}
my_list_tuple_list = list(my_tuple_list)
my_list_tuple_list
type(my_list_tuple_list)
```

---
## Functions, tuples and lists

**Remember!**

* Square brackets [] for indexing and lists.


* Parentheses () for functions and tuples.

---
## Dictionaries

Another data type are dictionaries. Dictionaries are made of key:value pairs. 

A key is some kind of identifier, typically a short string. The value is a corresponding piece of data that is often more complex. 

This structure allows the organization of your data, and you can gives you the ability to grab out values using the key.
  
---
## Dictionaries

```{python}
my_dict = {
    'my_list': [1,2,3],
    'my_tuple': (4,5,6),
    'language': 'python',
    'technique': 'scRNAseq'
}
my_dict
```

---
## Dictionaries

There are attribute functions that we can use to access the keys and values from our dictionary. 

```{python}
my_dict.keys()
```


```{python}

my_dict.values()
```


---
## Dictionaries

```{python}

my_dict['my_list']
```

```{python}

my_dict['language']

my_dict.get('language')
```

---
## Dictionaries

```{python}

my_dict.setdefault('metadata', True)
my_dict
```

```{python}

'metadata' in my_dict.keys()

'metadata' in my_dict

```


```{python}

'scRNAseq' in my_dict.values()

```


---
## Concatenating Dictionaries

```{python}
dict_1 = {'my_list': [1,2,3],
  'my_tuple': (4,5,6),}
  
dict_2 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

There are 3 options:

* Unpacking operator

```{python}

dict_3 = {**dict_1, **dict_2}
dict_3

```

---
## Concatenating Dictionaries

* Merge with pipe

```{python}

dict_3 = dict_1 | dict_2
dict_3

```

---
## Concatenating Dictionaries

* Update function

```{python}

dict_1.update(dict_2)

dict_1
```


---
## Sets

```{python}
myset = {"a", "b", "c"}
myset
myset = set(["a", "b", "c"])
myset
```

---
## Sets can be modified

```{python}
myset.add("d")
myset
```

```{python}
myset.remove("d")
myset
```

---
## Sets have no order

As sets have no order they can't be subset in the same way that other objects can be. 

```{python, eval=F, echo=T}

myset[0]

```

```{python, eval=T, echo=F}

try:
  myset[0]
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

```

---
## Sets are unique

```{python}
myset = set(["a", "b", "c","c","c"])
myset
```

---
## Sets have specific functions

```{python}
myset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
myset2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
myset1.union(myset2)
```
 
 
```{python}
myset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
myset2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
myset1.difference(myset2)
```
 
---
## Set vs List
 
* A list allows duplicate elements and maintains their order
* A set ensures element uniqueness without any guaranteed order

# NumPy: A python library for arrays

"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# NumPy: A python library for arrays
      
---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## NumPy

Many of the data types we have looked at thus far are either one-dimensional, or get quite complex when built up into multidimensional data frames. These can become relatively slow and cumbersome to work with if you have large datasets. 

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays, that are common in biological data. It is not included in the base distribution of Python so it has to be installed and loaded in separately. We installed NumPy earlier. Here we load it into our python session with *import*.

```{python}
import numpy
```

Often an alias is used when you import a library. Here we are importing NumPy *as* np.

```{python}
import numpy as np
```


---
## NumPy array

Within our imported NumPy library we have many different functions. Here we will use the *array()* function to create an array. In this case we are essentially are creating a list (square brackets), than coercing it into an array. 

```{python}
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

type(arr)
```

```{python}
arr
```

---
## Adding Dimensions

It is possible to create many kinds of arrays, with differing dimensionality. They can be 1D,2D,3D etc. Typically we think about 2D arrays as this is often the rectangular data we deal with. 

Here we again create a list to coerce into a array. This time we have a list of lists. Each list will become equivalent to a row in our array.


```{python}

arr = np.array([["Patient1","Patient2","Patient3"],[34, 29, 40], [True,False,True]])
arr

```

We can find out the dimension attribute by using *ndim*. In this case we have rectangular data so it is two dimensions. 

```{python}

arr.ndim

```

---
## Indexing Arrays

We can use same square brackets we used for other data objects to index our arrays. The big difference is we now have 2 dimensions. We therefore need to provide 2 indexes, separated by a comma. 

The first number will correspond to row. The second number will correspond to row.

```{python}
arr[0,2]
```

---
## Slicing Arrays

We can also do more complex indexing operations like slicing, to get ranges of values from our array.


```{python}
arr[:,2]

```

```{python}
arr[0,1:3]

```

---
## Data Types and arrays

In most data objects we have looked as so far there are limited types of data: *str*,*float*, *int* and *boolean*. Arrays accept all of these. We can always check the type with the *dtype* attribute.

```{python}

arr = np.array([34, 29, 40])
arr.dtype

```

```{python}

arr = np.array([True,False,True])
arr.dtype

```

---
## Data Types and arrays

When you create the array you can specify what type you want the data to be. This can coerce the input data ... within reason. 

```{python}

arr = np.array([34, 29, 40], dtype='S')

arr

```

```{python, eval=F, echo=T}

arr = np.array(['a', '2', '3'], dtype='i')

```

```{python, eval=T, echo=F}
try:
  arr = np.array(['a', '2', '3'], dtype='i')
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

```

---
## Joining Arrays

```{pyhton}
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

arr = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))

```


```{pyhton}
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

arr2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

arr = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2), axis=1)

print(arr)
```

```{pyhton}

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

arr = np.stack((arr1, arr2), axis=1)

print(arr)\\h/vstack
```


---
## other things

pi, cos sine, exp etc

"    
  )
}else{

"    
  )
  
}

```

---
## Making functions

Key parts:
* function name
* arguments
* code
* return values (sometimes)

---
## Making functions

Function structure:

def - indicates you will define a function
function name - in this case *myFirstFunction*
arguments - any arguments that the function expects in parentheses
code - the start of the code is indicated by a colon, new line and indentation
return - this is the result that you wish to be delivered from the function

```{python}
def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  return sumNum

myResult = myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)
myResult
```



---
## Returning multiple values

We can only return 1 object at a time from function. Here we create the multiple of our numbers and try and return alongside our sum. It wont even let us define the function. 

```{python, eval=F, echo=T}

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  return sumNum multipleNum

```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}

cat('File "<string>", line 1
    return sumNum multipleNum
IndentationError: unexpected indent')

# try:
#   def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
#     sumNum = num1 + num2
#     multipleNum = num1*num2
#     return sumNum multipleNum
# except Exception as e:
#   print(e)

```

---
## Returning multiple values

A simple solution is to pass back an object that contains both results. Here we create a quick list.


```{python}

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  return [sumNum, multipleNum]

myResult = myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)
myResult
```

## Evaluate until return

In a function containing a return statement, the code up until the return statement is evaluated and anything after the return statement is not evaluated.

```{python}

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  print("Before return")
  return [sumNum, multipleNum]
  print("After return")

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)

```

---
## No return statement

If a function does not contain a return statement nothing will come back. In other languages this is not the case. 

```{python, function_noreturn}

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)

```

## Variable scope in functions

Variables defined in the arguments or within the function exist only within the environment of the function.

```{python, eval=F, echo=T}

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  return [sumNum, multipleNum]

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)

sumNum

```

```{python, eval=T, echo=F}

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2):
  sumNum = num1 + num2
  multipleNum = num1*num2
  return [sumNum, multipleNum]

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3)

try:
  sumNum
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

```

## Variable scope in functions

If a function makes changes to variables defined in the global environment they will not be updated in the global environment.

```{python, eval=F, echo=T}
num3 = 4

def myFirstFunction(num1, num2, num3):
  num3 = num1+num2+num3
  return num3

myFirstFunction(num1=2, num2=3, num3=num3)

num3

```

## Local vs Global scope

* Functions have local scope. This means they have access to global variables can be used anywhere and local variables which were made within the function. 

* Once you exit the function you are in the console you are back to a global scope. Local variables can not be accessed at this point. 

* Code in a function’s local scope cannot use variables in any other local scope i.e. between functions.

* Though it is possible to have local and global variables with the same name, try and give everything unique names so you can keep track of everything.

## Argument defaults

Functions can have defaults for their arguments which will be used when arguments are not specified.

```{python}
def myFirstFunction(num1=1,num2=3):
  sumNum = num1+num2
  return sumNum

myFirstFunction()

```

```{python}
myFirstFunction(5,10)
```
