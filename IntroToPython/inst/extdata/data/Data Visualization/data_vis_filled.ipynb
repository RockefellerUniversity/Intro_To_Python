These Notebooks are a useful way to present your results to your collaborators, and to the scientific community at large. \n",

    "1. Generate or import the data to be plotted. This is generally a list of x values and a list of y values for 2-dimensional plots.\n",

    "3. Generate the figure and axes\n",
    "4. Plot the data on the appropriate axis or axes using functions such as `plot()`, `scatter()`, `bar()`, etc..\n",
    "5. Customize your plot using the built-in options for the function you used to plot (found in documentation).\n",
    "6. Render your plot and save or export it if you wish.\n",

    "## Matplotlib\n",

    "Matplotlib is Python's library for visualization. It has extensive documentation available [online](https://matplotlib.org/stable/), including many [tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html). Within Matplotlib, you will mostly be working with `pyplot` to generate simple plots. You can view the documentation for [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html#module-matplotlib.pyplot) here. Each function within pyplot has detailed descriptions of the arguments it takes - these will be very useful when you would like to customize your plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "To import `matplotlib.pyplot`, type `import matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` at the top of your code. You can then refer to the library as plt in your code as needed. Note that this isn't strictly necessary, but you will find that this is an almost-universal naming convention (other libraries follow similar conventions too)."
