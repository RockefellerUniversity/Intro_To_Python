These exercises are about ??Add a summary of the topic?? [??Topic Name??](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_course_template/). 

**Exercise 1** - **??Ex 1 title if it has one??**

- ??What is the first question??
```{r,echo=toMessage}
## Add the solution in here. This will only be included in the exercise sections. This is controlled by the echo=toMessage in the markdown header  ie:

cat("Hello World")

a<-1+2
b<-3+4

mean(a,b)

```

- ??What is the second question??
```{r,echo=toMessage}
## If your questions are too labor intensive to actually do during compilation you can add eval=F to the markdown header.

## A caveat of using eval=F is you cannot check the code is running accurately, so it is good to at elast double check it yourself first

## If any subsequent chunks rely on answers from a chunk that is eval=F, you will need to load them back in. Ideally this will be done behind the scenes by setting echp=F for the chunk that just loads. 


```


?? You can just keep adding questions in this format ??
